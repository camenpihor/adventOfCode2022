# how to rust

1. install: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

2. generally, you should be able to run the executables by `cd`ing to
   the project directories (e.g. `day_one/`) and running `cargo run`,
   which will build and execute the main function. You can pass args
   with `cargo run -- arg1 arg2`.
